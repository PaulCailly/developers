# Private registry setup

You need to use npm to fetch the two necessary packages `@deezer/sdk-auth` and `@deezer/sdk-player`

To configure you machine to download '@deezer' packages from the right registry, run the following command

## Setup custom registry

`npm config set @deezer:registry https://deezerpps.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/web-sdk/`

## Login to the registry

Then, use your JFrog credentials to login to the repository by running (youâ€™ll be asked to provide the credentials detailed below):

`npm login --scope=@deezer --registry=https://deezerpps.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/web-sdk/`

> JFrog credentials are provided to you by Deezer, check on the RC documentation on Confluence to find them

## Try to install deezer packages

You should now be able to install the deezer SDK packages in your application by running:

`npm i @deezer/sdk-auth @deezer/sdk-player`
