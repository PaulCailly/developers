## Setup & rules to follow

- You must use a single instance of the SDK Player across your app
- We recommend that you create your instance at the top of the app and expose the instance to the rest of the app
- The SDK instance must be created only after the user has logged in and has valid tokens

> Note: For instance, we made a React context provider to create the SDKPlayer instance and expose it to our components

```ts
type SDKPlayerOptions = {
  /**
   * Enables gapless playback and streaming optimizations.
   * This setting is recommended for STBs.
   */

  /**
   * The number of seconds allowed in the buffer.
   * Please note the real number of seconds can exceed this number, depending on the size of chunk wrote in the sink.
   * The default value is 30 seconds. The minimum allowed value is 5 seconds which is recommended for low performance devices.
   */

  /**
   * Enables Time To Play performance measurement.
   * This will save in local storage a `measures` object with time to load, time to play (on togglePlay and next) and progress when first progress event is triggered.
   */

  /**
   * Fill your app name, app version, app id and device name. They will be transmitted in
   * Deezer log db when a track is read

For the GraphQL data needed to run the SDK, please refer to [this doc](./02-GraphQL.mdx)

## Events

In order to get information about the state of the player, the queue or the progress, you will need to use events.

It will guarantee you always have the fresh information, as well as let you the choice to listen to what you need, only when you need it.

### Subscribing and unsubscribing to events

```ts
import SDKPlayer, {SDKPlayerEvent} from '@deezer/sdk-player';
const sdk = new SDKPlayer({...});
const unsubscribe = sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent, callback); // subscribe to event

unsubscribe(); // when you want to cleanup the event listener
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.PLAYBACK_STATE_CHANGED

```ts
enum SDKPlayerState {
  PAUSED = 'PAUSED',
  /**
   * Is trying to play, but still processing or fetching data
   */
  LOADING = 'LOADING',
  /**
   * The player is actually playing sound
   */
  PLAYING = 'PLAYING',
}
enum RepeatMode {
  /**
   * Repeat the queue
   */
  REPEAT_MODE_ALL = 'REPEAT_MODE_ALL',

  /**
   * Repeat the current track indefinitely
   */
  REPEAT_MODE_ONE = 'REPEAT_MODE_ONE',
  REPEAT_MODE_NONE = 'REPEAT_MODE_NONE',
}
type SDKPlaybackState = {
  state: SDKPlayerState;
 shuffled: boolean;
 canShuffle: boolean;
 repeat: RepeatMode;
 currentTrackIndex: number;
 currentTrack: SDKMediaRequest | null;
 canEditQueue: boolean;
 canPrevious: boolean;
};

sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent.PLAYBACK_STATE_CHANGED, (state: SDKPlaybackState) => void);
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.QUEUE_UPDATED

When a new queue is set or the current queue is updated (for example after a track loads or when adding/removing a track from the queue), you can retrieve the new queue and update your UI.

```ts
sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent.QUEUE_UPDATED, (queue: Playable[]) => void);
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.PROGRESS_CHANGED

When playing the progress change, you can subscribe to this event to update your UI (for example progress bar, timer)

```ts
type SDKPlaybackProgress = {
  positionPercent: number;
  position: number;
  duration: number;
};

sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent.PROGRESS_CHANGED, (progress: SDKPlaybackProgress) => void);
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.PLAYER_ERROR

When an error occurs you can retrieve the error with it's type, subtype, message and cause.

```ts
type SDKPlayerFailure {
 type: {
   name: string
 };
 subtype: {
   name: string
 }
 message: string;
 cause: Nullable<Error>;
}

sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent.PLAYER_ERROR, (error: SDKPlayerFailure) => void);
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.SINGLE_INSTANCE_PLAYBACK_MESSAGE_RECEIVED

Single Instance Playback (SIP) is the mechanism that prevent streaming from multiple device at the time with one account.
If you start the playback on device A and then start the playback on device B, then the playback will stop on device A and you will receive the `SDKPlayerEvent.SINGLE_INSTANCE_PLAYBACK_MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event. The playback will continue on device B. You can display a message to the user on device A explaining why the playback stopped.

```ts
sdk.subscribe(
  SDKPlayerEvent.SINGLE_INSTANCE_PLAYBACK_MESSAGE_RECEIVED,
  () => void,
);
```

### SDKPlayerEvent.MEDIA_STARTED

When a new media starts playing, you can subscribe to this event to update your UI. This event is triggered when the media starts playing, not when it is loaded.

```ts
sdk.subscribe(SDKPlayerEvent.MEDIA_STARTED, (playable: Playable) => void);
```

## Contexts

Possible contexts are exported as `SDKPossibleContextType` and you can use the `ContextType` enum:

```ts
export enum ContextType {
  FLOW = "flow_partner",
  SMART_TRACK_LIST = "smarttracklist_partner",
  ALBUM = "album_partner",
  PLAYLIST = "playlist_partner",
  TRACK = "track_partner",
  TALK = "talk_partner",
  RADIO = "radio_partner",
  LIVESTREAM = "livestream_partner",
  ARTIST = "artist_partner",
  FAVORITE_TRACKS = "favorite_tracks_partner",
  AUDIOBOOK = "audiobook_partner",
}

export type SDKPossibleContextType =
  | "flow_partner"
  | "smarttracklist_partner"
  | "album_partner"
  | "playlist_partner"
  | "track_partner"
  | "talk_partner"
  | "radio_partner"
  | "livestream_partner"
  | "artist_partner"
  | "favorite_tracks_partner"
  | "audiobook_partner"
  | "queue";
```

## Self managed queries vs integrated queries

You have the option of either handling queries on your own and passing them to the player through the `queries` property or utilizing integrated queries. It is not possible to use both mechanisms simultaneously.

The SDK provides a built-in GraphQL client and integrated methods, such as `playAlbum`, to easily play content. In order to use these integrated methods, you need to have a method for fetching the jwt token, `getToken`, and another for invalidating it `invalidateCurrentToken`. This can be accomplished by utilizing the Auth instance that you created using the `@deezer/sdk-auth` package.

## Methods

### togglePlay

When the user interacts with the play/pause button on a track, you must call `sdk.togglePlay`.

This method is powerful, because it will make your integration easy by handling such scenarios for free:

- User is not playing anything, queue is empty
- User clicks on a track in a playlist --> queue becomes this playlist, and starts to play at the selected track
- User goes on an album and ask for a track --> current queue is reset, new queue is created and becomes this album + starts at selected track

This kind of behavior is hard to manage with good consistency across an app, but since the SDK knows what is being played and from which context, it will behave exactly as you would expect.

```ts
type SDKPossibleContextType =
  | "flow_partner"
  | "smarttracklist_partner"
  | "album_partner"
  | "playlist_partner"
  | "track_partner"
  | "talk_partner"
  | "radio_partner"
  | "livestream_partner"
  | "queue";

type SDKPlaybackContext = {
  contextType: SDKPossibleContextType;
  /**
   * contextId is "playlistId" or "albumId"
   * Can be undefined if context is "queue", since there's no queue id
   */
  contextId?: string;
  trackIndex?: number;
  /**
   * Default is basic
   *
   * An infinite queue is a queue with no end, like a "Deezer Flow"
   * When user reaches the end of the queue, the SDK will ask for new tracks
   * through the queryCollection and append the result to the end of the queue.
   *
   * Some limitations with infinite queues: you can't edit them (append a track
   * to the end of the queue), shuffle is not available and repeat is "single track"
   * only.
   *
   * A basic queue is a finite queue, it is fully filled after a toggle play and
   * after the user adds a new track to the end of the queue.
   */
  queueType?: "infinite" | "basic";
  /**
   * Shuffle option. When set to true, the context tracklist is directly shuffled and added to the queue.
   * If a trackIndex is not specified, a random trackIndex from the context is played which is the first trackIndex of the queue.
   */
  shuffle?: boolean;
};

/**
 * Note: playbackContext is optional: don't specify it for player control, but specify it when
 * playing a specific track from a context (ex: play "this track in this playlist", you must specify the context)
 */
sdk.togglePlay(async (playbackContext?: SDKPlaybackContext) => Promise<void/>);
```

Otherwise, it will put the current track position to 0s

```ts
sdk.previous();
```

### seek

Allows navigation to a given position in a track

```ts
// Specify a new position in seconds
sdk.seek(newPosition: number);

// Or use the current position to define the new position
