# GraphQL API

## Setup & rules to follow

To call the Pipe GraphQL we use :

- [ Apollo react client ](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [ GraphQL Codegen ](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/index)

We configure the Apollo client to call `getToken` on the [auth module](./01-Authentication.mdx) instance on each request and set the proper header to specify the needed JWT.

For Typescript code generation we use [ GraphQL Codegen ](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/index) to allow the app to have definitely typed returns for each GraphQL operation.
