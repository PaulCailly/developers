# Introduction

Deezer's Software Development Kit (SDK) is a comprehensive set of tools designed to help you create a media app integrated with the vast Deezer Music catalogue. Available on iOS, Android, and Web platforms, our SDK offers you a simplified way to authenticate users, play music from our extensive library, and handle offline content.

Our SDK offers two primary utilities:

1. **Authentication Service:** This service identifies Deezer users and provides tokens to access our Pipe backend.
2. **Player:** This feature-rich player allows you to handle a variety of playback operations such as setting up a queue, managing track additions/removals, and controlling playback states.

The SDK also interfaces with our Partner API, enabling partners to create Deezer accounts, link them with subscriptions, and access the breadth of our music content.

Please note that while our player will play any list of IDs given to it, partners are responsible for verifying if the user has the rights to play the track. If a track is not available for a user, an error will be raised.

As for offline functionality, the SDK currently allows partners to download songs and receive the status for a specific song. While the SDK doesn't manage synchronization on its own, the V2 is in progress and should add features such as synchronization, downloading collections (playlist/album), and handling offline content updates.

Please be aware that the SDK does not provide metadata of tracks. Partners should request this information from Pipe to display any track information such as cover, title, artist name, etc.

To get started with the SDK, create a new application on the Deezer Developers platform, and request access on JFrog where the SDK is stored.

Happy coding!
